# Adventure Works Power BI Report (Practice with the tool and entire PBI WorkFlow)
*The PBIX file type requires download for viewing*
# Why?

This project is simply a practice run to sharpen up my ability with PowerBI and get more familiar with relevant components, from DAX to data modeling and even some light ETL as well as data visualisation work. A plethroa of different text files were used to import the data and run through the basic steps to remove duplicates, shape up columns, format properly and more.
